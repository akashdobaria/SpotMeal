The objective of SpotMeal is to provide a platform for people who are cooking enthusiasts but somehow are not able to open their own restaurants or are not professional chefs.Users can showcase their culinary skills to fellow foodies, interact with new people in the process and get reviews on some new dish they have created.

The “host” would post an “event” on SpotMeal which could be a one time event or a regular meal available every day.

A “guest” would look up an event and make a reservation request based on his food preference, proximity of the event and the reviews posted about the host.
